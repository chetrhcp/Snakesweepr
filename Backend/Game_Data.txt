--how to use:--

var Game = require("./game.js");

//the two parameters are strings indicating their username
var game = new Game(snake_user, ms_user);

//the game initializes when it is constructed, this just returns the initial game state
var output = game.gameInit();

//when you get data from a device

  game.update(data);
//the formatting for the data is below


---new game data---
{type:"new_game", lobby_name:"(*lobby name*)"}


[client stuff]
----Data received by device----

The data will be received as an object containing two smaller objects inside it:
one for the minesweeper data and one for the snake data.

ex. var object = {snake: {snake data}, minesweeper: {ms data}}




note: both players will get all of the data.
note: all points are objects that have an x and a y variable i.e. var p = {x:2,y:4}

--snake data--
  username: username of the snake player
  food_pos: a point that indicates where the food is to be placed
  walls: an array of points that indicates where the new walls should be placed
  score: how many points the snake player has.
  snake_pos: an array of points indicating where the snake is on the board
  died: boolean that is true if the snake hits a wall
  won: boolean that is true if the snake player has won

--minesweeper data--
  username: username of the minesweeper player
  mine_pos: an array of points where the mines are located.
  new_tiles: an array of points that are to be re-covered in the MS game
  score: how many points the MS player has
  died: boolean that is true if the ms player uncovers a bomb
  won: boolean that is true if the ms player has won

if a catagory is empty, assume nothing changes
